      Fiverr Affiliate Program Review
        </h1>
        <p>
            <span>
              Fiverr is the largest online marketplace for freelancers with services starting at five dollars. Freelance services fall into various categories including business, marketing, programming, design, writing, translation, video, music, and more. Additionally, there are over 150 service subcategories such as logo design, illustration, sales copy, product photography, voiceover, WordPress, and celebrity impersonators. Through the years, I’ve hired freelancers on Fiverr for many tasks like book cover design and explainer video creation.

              Fiverr Pro is Fiverr’s batch of top quality, verified, and hand-picked professionals who are “trusted by the world’s biggest brands.” Pro freelancers undergo extensive application processes, and only 1 percent of applicants get accepted.
              
              Fiverr is more than a freelancer market. Fiverr Learn features online courses starting at $19. Fiverr Elevate offers short classes and exclusive discounts for businesses at every stage. AND CO provides business software for creating proposals, contracting, invoicing, expense and time tracking, and reporting. ClearVoice helps companies create great content by bringing the process of content production together with a talented pool of creators.

          Fiverr Affiliate Program
          
        </h1>
        <p>
          Fiverr has two affiliate programs, which anyone can join. One uses affiliate tracking software from Cellxpert, and the other is hosted on the CJ Affiliate network. I previously promoted Fiverr using CJ Affiliate links. However, I now promote using Cellxpert, since first-party links are more advantageous and efficient. Let’s review the benefits, drawbacks, commission rate, cookie duration, and program details. Here’s a snapshot.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li> Category: Online services</li>
         <li>Cost per action (CPA): Cost per sale</li>
          <li>Commission rate: Up to $150</li>
          <li>Commission type: Nonrecurring and recurring options</li>
            <li>Cookie duration: 30 days</li>
            <li>Payout threshold: $100</li>
            <li>Payment options: PayPal</li>
            <li>Affiliate software/network: Cellxpert and CJ Affiliate</li>
        </ul>
     
      
   <h1>
    Program Benefits
   </h1>
   <p>
    The affiliate landing page is excellent. An affiliate landing page is supposed to be informative, and Fiverr hits the mark. Furthermore, they offer a how to get started guide, video tutorials, and FAQ on the signup page.

    The commission rates are excellent. Fiverr offers two commission plans, i.e., a $15 to $50 CPA for first-time buyers and a $10 CPA plus 10 percent revenue share for purchases made within the first 12 months. For the $15 to $50 CPA plan, your earnings will depend on the service subcategory, for example:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li>
      Whiteboard and explainer videos – $50
     </li>
     <li>
      WordPress – $40
    </li>
    <li>
    Business copywriting – $30
    </li>
    <li>
      Articles and blog posts – $25
    </li>
    <li>
      All other subcategories – $15
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Commissions are available for other Fiverr products. You’ll make $150 for Fiverr Pro, 30% for Fiverr Learn, and 30% for AND CO transactions.

    You’ll earn 10 percent of revenues from the sales of your sub-affiliates. Publishers who signup to Fiverr’s affiliate program through your unique sub-affiliate link become a part of your potential earnings.
    
    Affiliates get a 30-day cookie. One of my biggest complaints with some programs is that their cookie/conversion windows are too short. Fiverr provides a standard referral period to get credit for sales.
    
    Deep linking is available.
    
    Deep linking isn’t available. Deep linking is how an affiliate creates a link to a specific page on the merchant’s site. For example, instead of using a generic homepage affiliate link, I can link to an article related to my post. Deep linking is very beneficial given the amount and uniqueness of services available on Fiverr. You can learn how to deep-link in the FAQ.
    
    There are thousands of marketing materials to use. Fiverr provides a plethora of creatives and banners in various file formats, sizes, and languages. It’s one of the most comprehensive offerings of any affiliate program.
    
    There’s a full-time affiliate marketing team, which you can reach on the contact page. When a merchant has the staff to support publishers, it quickens processes and shows commitment.
    
    Affiliates get different payment options. You can choose from USD, EUR, and GBP currencies. You can receive money via PayPal, Payoneer, and your bank account (wire and ACH transfer).
    
    Fiverr is a market leader. Given its dominance, unique value propositions, and expanding services; it’s a fantastic company to promote. It doesn’t have any robust competitors (Upwork, a freelancer marketplace, targets a different user group and doesn’t have an affiliate program).
    
    Customers can find every service imaginable. Most services on Fiverr belong to conventional categories, including design, business, marketing, and so on. However, the “fun & lifestyle” category is where you’ll find interesting and unique services from impersonators, pranksters, gamers, and relationship experts. For instance, there are Jesus impersonators and someone who will “save your marriage with a potent psychic love spell.” Secondly, there are many gag services that would make excellent gifts.
   </p>
  <h1>
    Program Drawbacks 
  
</h1>
<p>
  Commissions only apply to first-time buyers. Most programs reward publishers for every sale regardless of buyer status, which is why affiliate marketing is an attractive way to make money online. Fiverr’s restrictive first-time buyer clause is very unappealing and creates somewhat of a win-lose proposition. Conversely, it does offset this a bit with its $10 CPA plus revenue share commission plan.

  The payout threshold is high. Fiverr issues payments when commissions exceed 100 USD or currency equivalent. A $50 threshold is commonplace and would be more favorable.
  
  Affiliate tracking software should be more efficient. Affiliates must request their payments because the app doesn’t automatically process commissions. For instance, I had requested a payment of $133.15. A few days later, it went into “pending” status then changed to “declined.” Also, all my commissions vanished. I sent an email to Fiverr’s affiliate team, and they said it was a “human error,” not software. The matter was resolved quickly, but I was left scratching my head. Although I prefer self-hosted software and first-party links, Fiverr should consider moving away from Cellxpert.
  
  Fiverr Pro commissions are capped. Some Fiverr Pro services cost as much as $8,500. However, the most you can earn is $150 per sale. A variable commission rate on Fiverr Pro sales would be more beneficial, for example, 10 percent.

  Making Money
  
</h1>
<p>
  Can you make four figures a month as a Fiverr affiliate? You can and more. Fiverr is a market leader with an excellent and rewarding affiliate program. There are thousands of unique services to promote, which yields many promotional opportunities. It pays excellent commission rates, and the self-hosted software is efficient. Furthermore, there’s the potential for higher payouts for high-volume affiliates. The only drawback is the first-time buyer stipulation, which can constrain earnings.

  Where should Fiverr rank in your marketing activities? It should be a mid priority. If your niche is freelancing, SMB, or the gig economy, you could make it a high priority. Fiverr’s strong brand and various freelancer tools make it a promising merchant.
  
  I recommend joining Fiverr’s affiliate program because it has excellent potential, and I’ve made money with it.
